**Jordan Rodu**<br> Department of Statistics<br> The University of Virginia<br> Charlottesville, VA

I am an associate professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Virginia. My research interests include statistical visualization, theory of reasoning with data, and time series. I spend a lot of time thinking about the fuzzy space between statistics and machine learning/AI.
