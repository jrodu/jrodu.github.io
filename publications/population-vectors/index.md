Much attention has been paid to the question of how Bayesian integration of information could be implemented by a simple neural mechanism. We show that population vectors based on point-process inputs combine evidence in a form that closely resembles Bayesian inference, with each input spike carrying information about the tuning of the input neuron. We also show that population vectors can combine information relatively accurately in the presence of noisy synaptic encoding of tuning curves.
